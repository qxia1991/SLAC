/// The following description is outdated, we only use binary files at the
//moment.  M. Marino 29 Nov 2012

As of 1/19/09 (svn repository revision 1623), the three 
potential files used by EXOsim to calculate the wire signals 
have been converted from ascii to binary to save disk space. The 
original files, phid.dat, phiwx.dat, and phiwy.dat, were created 
by the MAXWELL field simulation software at SLAC. The .dat files 
have the advantage of being human readable, but they take up 81 
MB of disk space each time the repository is downloaded. The .dat 
files still exist in the repository up to revision 1622, so they 
can be retrieved if necessary. The binary files are called 
phid.dat.bin, phiwx.dat.bin, and phiwy.dat.bin, and they occupy 
a total of 13.4 MB.

Two boolean variables have been added to EXODigitizer to control 
the use of the potential files. To switch between using binary 
files and ascii files, set "use_binary_potential_files" to true 
or false in the EXODigitizer constructor. To create new binary 
files from existing ascii files, set "create_binary_potential_file" 
to true in the constructor. No function has been written at this 
time to create an ascii file from a binary file. 

A note about units. The potential values and x-z coordinates in the 
ascii files are written in units of kV and centimeters, respectively. 
The EXODigitizer function which reads the ascii files, 
"read_ascii_potential_file()", multiplies the values read from the 
file by the appropriate CLHEP unit to account for this. Therefore the 
values stored in memory are scaled from the values written in the 
ascii file. For the binary files, no scaling has been done, such that 
the values are written in the file in units of volts and mm, which are 
the CLHEP basis units for potential and length. The function which 
reads the binary files, "read_binary_potential_file()" does not 
multiply by any units, under the assumption that the values in the 
file are already correct for CLHEP. However, if a future version of 
CLHEP were to change the basis units for potential or length (which 
seems unlikely), this assumption would break down, and the 
EXODigitizer code will need to be generalized.
