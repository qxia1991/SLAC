# This macro file generates the Rn-222 decay chain 
# occuring uniformly throughout the liquid xenon.
# Scintillation light is generated and tracked around 
# the detector with a yield of 14000 photons/MeV.

# Keep only events in the liquid xenon

/event/LXeEventsOnly false

# Turn on scintillation at 14000 photon per MeV
